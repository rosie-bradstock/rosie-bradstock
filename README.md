Hi! I'm Rosie. I'm an 18 year old student currently completing my A-levels

I'm interested in all things tech, and plan to go to university next year to study Computer Science.

Things I'm currently working on:
-  Fractals! - I've now completed my goal of creating a mandelbrot fractal in C# (with a lot of help) but I'm still very intrested in the underlying maths behind fractals, and am keen to pursue these further.
-  My Website - I've mapped out the basic elements, but there's always room for more!
-  My Computer Science NEA - I'm making a projectile motion based archery game, set in space! This means that the gravitational field strengths affecting the motion of the arrow will differ on the different planets. This project is for school, but is challenging my use of maths and design in oder to bring the whole thing together
-  School work - I study Maths, Physics and Computer science (as well as having previously completed an EPQ), and these subjects require a lot of work and commitment

Projects I want to do in the future:
- Game design (self explanatory)

I'm always up to learning more, and hope to expand my knowledge of programming and technology in order to understand and solve more complicated problems (If you're from a university, please let me in)
