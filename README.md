Hi! I'm Rosie. I'm a 19 year old student.

I'm currently studying for a Bsc Computer Science at university. My next three or four years will hopefully see me progress in a number of languages, and create some impressive projects!

It's a goal of mine to develop my own game, so I want to prepare for this by learning the basics of Unity or a similar engine.
