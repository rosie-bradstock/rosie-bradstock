Hi! I'm Rosie. I'm an 18 year old student.

I'm interested in all things tech, and plan to go to university next year to study Computer Science.

I hope to use some of my summer holidays to work on more coding projects in preperation for (hopefully) my degree next year. This could include more work with languages that I'm already familiar with, or picking up some new ones entirely.

It's a goal of mine to develop my own game, so I want to prepare for this by learning the basics of Unity or a similar engine.
